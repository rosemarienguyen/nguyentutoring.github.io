				<h3>John Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
				<p><img class="picture" src="profjohn.png">Hi! I am a college sophomore currently seeking my BS in
					Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. My
					SAT was in the 99.3% percentile with a 23/24 essay score. I'm a tech nerd with a passion for music:
					I have a published app on the Google Play store and I've won national awards as a rising flute
					soloist. Additionally, I have received academic recognitions including the Academic Excellence
					Scholarship with Distinction, AP Scholar with Distinction, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, Beaverton
					Elks Foundation Scholarship, Association of Beaverton School District Administrators Scholarship,
					Beaverton Arts Foundation Scholarship, and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame Scholarship.
					<br>
					<br>
					With nearly five years of experience, I formerly held a private contract with Varsity Tutors and was
					among their top 10% hand-picked tutors worldwide with a perfect 5.0-star rating. I am passionate
					about teaching and I focus especially on developing independent study habits. I develop personal
					relationships with my students and instill a lifelong excitement for learning. At the same time, I
					set high standards for my students, only expecting the best out of them while adjusting to their
					strengths, weaknesses, and pacing. My methods have helped top students improve scores up to 400
					points and assisted students with disabilities, such as dyslexia and ADHD, realize their potential.

				<h3>Rosie Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
				<p><img class="picture" src="profrosie.png">Hello! I am originally from Portland, OR, and am going into
					my third year at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based scholarship. I have
					interests in tech and business, seeking a BS in Information Technology with a minor in Marketing. I
					have received awards such as National Merit Commendation, AP Scholar with Distinction, Kiwanis Key
					Club Scholarship, Vietnamese Community of Oregon Scholarship, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, and
					Academic Excellence Scholarship with Honors.
					<br> <br>
					In high school I received a 1550 (750 Reading and 800 Math) on the SAT and 33 on the ACT. I then
					started tutoring for fun, helping my siblings and friends and eventually moving to the Varsity
					Tutors platform. I have been tutoring for over two years now, maintaining a 5-star rating with
					dozens of students. I specialize in Math and SAT Prep, but have helped in other subjects including
					Excel, Powerpoint, and Study Habits. My students have all done exceptionally well on their tests,
					experiencing increases in grade and SAT scores; my top students have seen over a 400 point
					difference. My goal is to connect and build relationships with them in order to maximize their
					capabilities and help them grow. Working on habits and skills with them will also translate into
					important traits used in college and the workplace.
					<br> <br>
					Looking forward to hearing from you soon :)</p>

			<p id="heading">More Than Your Average Tutor</p>
			<p>As the oldest siblings of a large family, we know how much the SAT impacts admissions decisions. We
				commit our hearts to all our students, inspiring and motivating them to success. Throughout our years of
				experience, we've learned to pinpoint our students' weaknesses and check in with the parents to
				understand our students better, and provide additional workshops, presentations, and proctored exams on
				our own unpaid time. Every student is expected to work very hard.
				<br>
				<br>
				Our approach is more than just an SAT boost. We provide the critical support our students need to spark
				an intellectual curiosity that naturally correlates to high performance on the SAT. Our students attain
				a voracious excitement for learning and a passion for following their interests. They learn to excel in
				the SAT and apply those same lessons of dedication, self-motivation, and grit to their life. They learn
				to be proactive and create opportunities for themselves and for members of their community.
				<br>
				<br>
				We value all our students regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation,
				ability, gender identity, or age. Joining our tutoring family means that we will deeply care about your
				personal and academic goals. We periodically switch off on teachers to ensure that every student will
				experience a fresh approach to the SAT and connection to us in order to foster a supportive learning
				environment. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="better-score">
			<p id="heading">Better Score Guarantee.</p>
			<p>We personally guarantee an improvement on your SAT or you will receive all your money back, no questions
				asked. The improvement margin will be measured by your first official College Board exam score you ever
				took or by the first exam score you take with us during a proctored exam session to the College Board
				official test.
				<br>
				<br>
				Keep in mind, this is the bare minimum that we guarantee. Most of our students do much better than that
				with incredible score improvements up by 400 points.</p>
