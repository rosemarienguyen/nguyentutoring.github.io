						<h3>John Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
						<p><img class="picture" src="profjohn.png">Hi! I am a college sophomore currently seeking my BS
							in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based
							scholarship. My SAT was in the 99.3% percentile with a 23/24 essay score. I'm a tech nerd
							with a passion
							for music: I have a published 5-star app on the Google Play store and I've won competitions
							hosted by the National Flute Association. Additionally, I have received academic
							recognitions including the Academic Excellence Scholarship with Distinction, AP Scholar with
							Distinction, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship,
							Beaverton Elks Foundation Scholarship, Association of Beaverton School District
							Administrators
							Scholarship, Beaverton Arts Foundation Scholarship, and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame
							Scholarship.
							<br>
							<br>
							Teaching for over five years, I began as a flute teacher in Beaverton, Oregon. I then started tutoring SAT at
							various places: Varsity Tutors with a perfect 5.0-star rating, Wyzant with a 5.0-star rating, and 35
							Academy. Recently, I was awarded the Top 10 Tutor Award by Tutors.com, where I was among
							their top 6% of tutors worldwide. I focus especially on developing independent study habits
							and invigorating students to love learning. I maintain personal relationships
							with my students and help them with college essays and advice. At the same time, I set
							high standards for my
							students, only expecting the best out of them while adjusting to their strengths,
							weaknesses, and pacing. My methods have helped ambitious students improve scores up to 400
							points and assisted students with disabilities, such as dyslexia and ADHD, regain their
							confidence. </p>

						<h3>Rosie Nguyen, 99th Percentile SAT Tutor</h3>
						<p><img class="picture" src="profrosie.png">Hello! I am originally from Portland, OR, and am
							going into my third year at The University of Texas at Dallas on a full-tuition merit-based
							scholarship. I have interests in tech and business, seeking a BS in Information Technology
							with a minor in Marketing. I have received awards such as National Merit Commendation, AP
							Scholar with Distinction, Kiwanis Key Club Scholarship, Vietnamese Community of Oregon
							Scholarship, Intel Andy Grove Scholarship, and Academic Excellence Scholarship with Honors.
							<br> <br>
							In high school I received a 1550 (750 Reading and 800 Math) on the SAT and 33 on the ACT. I
							then started tutoring for fun, helping my siblings and friends and eventually moving to the
							Varsity Tutors platform. I have been tutoring for over two years now, maintaining a 5-star
							rating with dozens of students. I specialize in Math and SAT Prep, but have helped in other
							subjects including Excel, Powerpoint, and Study Habits. My students have all done
							exceptionally well on their tests, experiencing increases in grade and SAT scores; my top
							students have seen over a 400 point difference. My goal is to connect and build
							relationships with them in order to maximize their capabilities and help them grow. Working
							on habits and skills with them will also translate into important traits used in college and
							the workplace.
							<br> <br>
							Looking forward to hearing from you soon :)</p>

				<div id="family">
					<p id="heading">More Than Your Average Tutor</p>
					<p>As the oldest siblings of a large family, we know how much the SAT impacts admissions decisions.
						It's why we commit our hearts to all our students, inspiring and motivating them to success.
						Throughout
						our years of experience, we've learned to pinpoint our students' weaknesses and check in with
						the parents to understand our students better, and provide additional workshops, presentations,
						and proctored exams on our own unpaid time. Every student is expected to work very hard.
						<br>
						<br>
						Our approach is more than just an SAT boost. We provide the critical support our students need
						to spark an intellectual curiosity that naturally correlates to high performance on the SAT. Our
						students attain a voracious excitement for learning and a passion for following their interests.
						They learn to excel in the SAT and apply those same lessons of dedication, self-motivation, and
						grit to their life. They learn to be proactive and create opportunities for themselves and for
						members of their community.
						<br>
						<br>
						We value all our students regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual
						orientation, ability, gender identity, or age. Joining our tutoring family means that we will
						deeply care about your personal and academic goals. We periodically switch off on teachers to
						ensure that every student will experience a fresh approach to the SAT and connection to us in
						order to foster a supportive learning environment. </p>
				</div>

				<div id="better-score">
					<p id="heading">Better Score Guarantee.</p>
					<p>We personally guarantee an improvement on your SAT or you will receive all your money back, no
						questions asked. The improvement margin will be measured by your first official College Board
						exam score you ever took or by the first exam score you take with us during a proctored exam
						session to the College Board official test.
						<br>
						<br>
						Keep in mind, this is the bare minimum that we guarantee. Most of our students do much better
						than that with incredible score improvements up by 400 points.</p>
